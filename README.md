# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

해당 폴더 내부에 `node_modules` 파일이 없을 경우 아래의 명령어를 실행하면 됨:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Firebase 설정

### 절대로 토큰 내용을 github에 올리지 마세요
-  `git update-index --assume-unchanged <filename>` 을 통해서 git의 해당 파일의 업데이트 트래킹을 멈출 수 있습니다.

### token.json 설정하기
1. Firebase 프로젝트 메인화면 상단에 있는 앱 추가하기 버튼을 누른다.

2. 웹앱 페이지 하단에 있는 토큰을 복사한다.
<img src="./readme_image/webtoken.png" style="width: 70%">

3. `src/token.json` 에 토큰을 아래와 같이 복사한다.

4. 위의 안내된 절차대로 react app을 시작하면 된다.
